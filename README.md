# bipartite networks

We construct bipartite graphs using data/equations of reduced models for the fully non-linear system describing turbulence in rotating flows.

## Setup

Output data is constructed using the ZonalFlow package, which can be installed from the repo:

```
add ZonalFlow
```

Run Julia to produce output data and analyse using Python notebook.
